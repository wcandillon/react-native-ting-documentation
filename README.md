React Native Ting is a flexible starter kit for React Native and NativeBase.
Ting is best suited for developing online marketplaces and hospitality service apps for both Android and iOS.
This project has been rewritten using es6 with flow annotations for type checking.
The visual design can easily be customized and all aspects of the app are implemented: from navigation using react-navigation to data management.

With the [expo client](https://expo.io/tools#mobile), you can try the starter kit by using this [link](https://expo.io/@wcandillon/react-native-ting).
